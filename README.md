## About

"Anime Manga Auto Backup" is my personal take to automate process in back-up your anime and manga libraries, automatically using worker like GitHub Actions or execute manually from your machine, from MyAnimeList.net, Kitsu, AniList, Annict, Baka-Updates Manga, Shikimori, Anime-Planet, Notify.moe, SIMKL, and Trakt. I use [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) to write the script because it is cross-platform and easy to use.

This project **requires you to set the library/list as public** as most API used in this projects are from 3rd party and **User Agent string may required to be filled in environment variable** for the backup progress works. You can check table below to see the library/list you need to set as public:

* `git`
* PowerShell Core (`pwsh`) version >= 7.0.0
* `python` version >= 3.7

You also need to fork the repository before cloning the repo to your local machine.

#### Run the script by service worker (GitHub Actions)

* [Fork the repository](https://github.com/nattadasu/animeManga-autoBackup/fork) OR [generate new repository using this repository](https://github.com/nattadasu/animeManga-autoBackup/generate)
  * Basically the differences are such:
    |                | Forked                     | Generated from Template                                      |
